author: IT Relation CDC
description: |
  This artifact will use yara to search for the affected Openssl 3.x version strings in binaries,
  excluding not vulnerable and forked libressl and boringssl, furthermore it has a regex that will try and match
  custom compiled vendor versions of OpenSSL ie. CiscoSSL 3.x.x
  
parameters:
  - name: UploadHits
    type: bool
  - name: YaraRule
    type: yara
    description: Final Yara option and the default if no other options provided.
